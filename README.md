# Personal-Website

I always wanted to store my thoughts somewhere, but meanwhile, when I started to write a website I realized, that the website could be more than just a good-looking database. I designed a website that works as a guidepost. The website includes all meaningful books that I read, links to my Spotify and youtube channels in which I have a subscription, and of course there are links to GitHub and Repl where I store most of my work and programming stuff. I also make one additional HTML file, where I keep people who affected me (in a good sense).

So let the story begin. :)
